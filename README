🎬 Movie Rating Prediction
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build a regression-based machine learning model that predicts the rating of a movie using key features such as genre, director, and cast. By analyzing historical movie data, the model estimates ratings given by users or critics, helping to uncover what truly drives cinematic success.
🧠 Objective
- Develop a predictive model using regression techniques
- Explore how different attributes influence movie ratings
- Deliver meaningful insights through data-driven storytelling
🚀 Technologies & Techniques Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Regression Algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Evaluation (R² Score, MSE)
📊 Key Insights
- Discover trends in movie ratings based on creative elements
- Understand feature importance and correlation patterns
- Build and evaluate models to estimate ratings with accuracy
📁 Dataset
Includes information on movie genres, directors, actors, and corresponding ratings from platforms like IMDb or other open-source movie datasets.
